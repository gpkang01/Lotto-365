## Lotto-6/45

1. This was made by Anaconda Jupyter Notebook for lotto lottery.
2. The data of the existing lottery is downloaded from www.dhlottery.co.kr site.
   But the format of the data is .xls which isn't opened by program.
   It should be changed to .xlsx format in manual.
3. It was based on my personal insight. So it won't ensure to win the lottery.
4. At the end of coding, number of "if prob_num > 0.34 and prob_num <= 0.38:" should be
   changed following your insight.
